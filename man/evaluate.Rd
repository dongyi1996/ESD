\title{Evaluate EOT-Based NDVI Resampling}
\usage{
evaluate(pred, resp, n = 10L, by = 24L, times = 10L, size = 5L,
  cores = 1L, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pred, resp}{\code{Raster*} objects used as predictor and response 
domains during EOT analysis.}

\item{n}{\code{integer}. Number of EOT modes to calculate.}

\item{by}{\code{integer}. Increment of the sequence passed to
\code{\link{seq}}, defaults to \code{24L} for half-monthly input data.}

\item{times}{\code{integer}. Determines the number of
\code{\link{evaluateCycle}} runs, from which average error and regression
metrics are subsequently calculated.}

\item{size}{\code{integer}. Sample size of the training dataset passed to
\code{\link{sample}}, defaults to \code{5L} for five years of training.}

\item{cores}{\code{integer}. Number of cores for parallel processing.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{write.csv}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame}.

\description{
Evaluate the performance of EOT-based spatial resampling (of the NDVI) on the
basis of selected error and regression metrics. The evaluation procedure is
carried out \emph{n} times, thus ensuring the deduction of more reliable
results from repeated calls to \code{\link{evaluateCycle}}.
